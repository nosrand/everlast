                        Deontay was a stellar athlete in high school, who had the opportunity to play college football and basketball; however, his priorities were elsewhere. His first born daughter Naieya was born with spinal bifida and required additional medical care. He worked two jobs to support his family, until he decided he was going to become a professional boxer, and a world champion at that. In 2005 in Alabama, where football trumps boxing, he walked into a gym and started training with his current trainer, Jay Deas.

                        With just 14 bouts under his belt, Wilder roared through the National Golden Gloves and US Championships in 2007, and he eventually won the Olympic trials with just 21 total amateur bouts. His improbable run continued in this summer’s Beijing Games, where he won two bouts before losing a semifinal decision to Italy’s Clemente Russo. Back home with a Bronze medal in his hand, Wilder got ready for the next chapter of this amazing story, becoming a professional boxer.

                        Karlos grew up in Santa Maria, where his family had a humble beginning to life in the United States. Karlos only started boxing because his 
                        father took him to the boxing gym as punishment for getting into fights. Despite his parents being in and out of his childhood, Karlos continued 
                        to chase his dream in becoming a great boxer. He represented the US in the 2016 Olympic Games, winning his first two opening bouts. 
                        He turned pro in 2017 and is one of the hottest prospects in the game.

                        Vergil Ortiz burst onto the scene as a prospect when Golden Boy Promotions signed him out of high school. Still young in his career, 
                        he was regarded as the top prospect in 2019 by publications such as ESPN, the Ring Magazine, etc. Still with plenty of room to grow,
                        Vergil looks to be the future of the sport and in the welterweight division.

                        most elite UFC Lightweights in the world. Dustin has an intense, exciting, and highly skilled fighting style, proven by the numerous times he has 
                        won Fight of the Night awards. Poirier is a brown belt in jiu-jitsu. In striking, he uses both power shots and combinations but puts in the most

                        After a very promising amateur career, Quigley seemed poised to follow the traditional route of a professional boxer with what was touted as 
                        a guaranteed spot on the 2016 Irish Olympic team. However he decided instead to turn pro, signing with Golden Boy Promotions in 2014.

                        Known as 'El Animal,' Jason went primal in his professional debut, winning by TKO just 82 seconds into the first round. Since then he has 
                        amassed an undefeated record of 15-0 with 11 knockouts, with 6 wins coming in 2015 alone.

                        as a ‘one-in-10-million’ hand injury. On his first fight back, Jason quickly returned to form, hitting his opponent with a vicious body shot and 
                        getting the knockout finish in the sixth round.
