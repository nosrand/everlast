JARRETT HURD
PROFESSIONAL JUNIOR MIDDLEWEIGHT BOXER

ABOUT
Jarrett was a bit of an unknown in his amateur career and professional upbringing. Hailing from Accokeek, MD, he only had forty amateur fights before he turned pro. Jarrett quickly made a mark in the boxing game as he had the personality and power to prove he was a star.

He is a former unified champ of the super welterweight division and has huge wins over Erislandy Lara, Austin Trout, and Tony Harrison. He looks to clean out his division and further his legacy, all while still living in his parent’s home.

“AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE POUND-FOR-POUND LIST IS ONLY OPINION. I DO THINK ABOUT THAT SOMETIMES, BUT I DON’T WORRY TOO MUCH BECAUSE I KNOW IN THE FUTURE I’LL BE THERE.”
