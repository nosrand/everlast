JASON QUIGLEY
PROFESSIONAL MIDDLEWEIGHT BOXER

ABOUT
After a very promising amateur career, Quigley seemed poised to follow the traditional route of a professional boxer with what was touted as a guaranteed spot on the 2016 Irish Olympic team. However he decided instead to turn pro, signing with Golden Boy Promotions in 2014.

Known as 'El Animal,' Jason went primal in his professional debut, winning by TKO just 82 seconds into the first round. Since then he has amassed an undefeated record of 15-0 with 11 knockouts, with 6 wins coming in 2015 alone.

Even with an unblemished record, Quigley is no stranger to adversity, recently returning to the ring from surgery on what his doctor described as a ‘one-in-10-million’ hand injury. On his first fight back, Jason quickly returned to form, hitting his opponent with a vicious body shot and getting the knockout finish in the sixth round.
