FRANSONET MARTINEZ
ASPIRING PROFESSIONAL BOXER

ABOUT
It was a big win when Fransonet started boxing again after an almost fatal car accident. He ended up having multiple surgeries and his leg amputated. Fransonet ‘Jinji’ Martinez then started competing again in a league where amputee boxers can box. He then became the first amputee boxer to compete and win against a fully bodied boxer in a USA boxing sanctioned bout. Fransonet is still fighting and he wants to now be the first above-the-knee amputee to fight in a professional fight.
