KARLOS BALDERAS
PROFESSIONAL LIGHTWEIGHT BOXER

ABOUT
Karlos grew up in Santa Maria, where his family had a humble beginning to life in the United States. Karlos only started boxing because his father took him to the boxing gym as punishment for getting into fights. Despite his parents being in and out of his childhood, Karlos continued to chase his dream in becoming a great boxer. He represented the US in the 2016 Olympic Games, winning his first two opening bouts. He turned pro in 2017 and is one of the hottest prospects in the game.
