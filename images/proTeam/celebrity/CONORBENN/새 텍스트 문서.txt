CONOR BENN
PROFESSIONAL WELTERWEIGHT BOXER

ABOUT
Despite being the son of a UK Boxing legend, Conor is more than making a name for himself as a top prospect in the welterweight division. His amateur career was a relatively short one. After turning pro, however, Conor has burst onto the scene winning regional belts and earning a long undefeated streak. He is set to graduate to the world level being a contender, and soon, a champion.
