WILLY HUTCHINSON
PROFESSIONAL SUPER MIDDLEWEIGHT BOXER


ABOUT
As one of Scotland’s greatest amateur boxers, Willy Hutchinson, racked up gold medals at the amateur level. His first place finish at the 2016 World Championships was the first gold medal by a Scottish boxer at the international level. After turning pro, “Braveheart” looks to storm through the super middleweight division and add a world title belt to his boxing resume.
