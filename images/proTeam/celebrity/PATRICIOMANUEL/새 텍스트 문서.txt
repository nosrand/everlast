PATRICIO MANUEL
PROFESSIONAL FEATHERWEIGHT BOXER

ABOUT
Patricio Manuel was a former qualifier for the US Women’s Olympic Trial team. Pat would need to put the sport of boxing on hold when he decided to transition. Not knowing if he would compete again, he went on with the transition and became the first trans boxer to compete in the paid professional ranks. Patricio won his first fight via unanimous decision.
