PROFESSIONAL LIGHTWEIGHT MMA FIGHTER


ABOUT
Dustin first started training to be a boxer in 2007. Later that year, a trip to his local MMA gym changed his life. Poirier turned professional in 2009 and was signed by WEC in 2010 after he amassed a 7-0 record. In 2011, Poirier made his UFC debut & has since proven to be one of the most elite UFC Lightweights in the world. Dustin has an intense, exciting, and highly skilled fighting style, proven by the numerous times he has won Fight of the Night awards. Poirier is a brown belt in jiu-jitsu. In striking, he uses both power shots and combinations but puts in the most work on his opponents with his boxing skills.
