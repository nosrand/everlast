VERGIL ORTIZ
PROFESSIONAL WELTERWEIGHT BOXER


ABOUT
Vergil Ortiz burst onto the scene as a prospect when Golden Boy Promotions signed him out of high school. Still young in his career, he was regarded as the top prospect in 2019 by publications such as ESPN, the Ring Magazine, etc. Still with plenty of room to grow, Vergil looks to be the future of the sport and in the welterweight division.
