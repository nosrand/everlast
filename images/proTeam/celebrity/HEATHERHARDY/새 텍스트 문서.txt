ABOUT
Heather “the Heat” Hardy is a known name in two sports, MMA and boxing. Her story begins at the Gleasons Gym where she not only trained out of, but lived in during a period in her life when she was homeless. Her determination was rewarded as she won the vacant WBO world title and her Bellator MMA debut. She now continues to fight and work as an advocate for women’s boxing.

HEATHER HARDY RECOMMENDS
“I HAVE A CONSTANT REMINDER EVERY SINGLE DAY, WHEN MY DAUGHTER COMES CRAWLING OUT OF HER BEDROOM, THAT I’M NOT JUST FIGHTING TO FIGHT, THAT I’M FIGHTING FOR ALL GIRLS LIKE MY DAUGHTER.”
