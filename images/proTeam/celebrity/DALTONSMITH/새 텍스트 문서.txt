DALTON SMITH
PROFESSIONAL SUPER LIGHTWEIGHT BOXER

ABOUT
As an amateur, Dalton is one of Sheffield’s all-time best. Fighting in the prestigious World Series of Boxing and winning the Commonwealth games made Dalton a blue-chip prospect for his native England. He soon turned pro in 2019 and has since lived up to the billing as one of Matchroom’s brightest prospects. Dalton looks to continue to grow his undefeated streak and join the long list of British fighters to win a major world title soon.

“I’LL HAVE TO GET A NEW TROPHY CABINET NOW TO STICK THE BELTS IN. THE AMATEURS ARE PASSED ME NOW AND SUCCESS IN PROFESSIONAL GAME IS MY NEW GOAL.”
