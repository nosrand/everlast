ALJAMAIN STERLING
PROFESSIONAL BANTAMWEIGHT MMA FIGHTER


ABOUT
Aljamain’s MMA base is his wrestling game. He started wrestling in high school, and that created a path for him to be the first in his family to attend college. While competing in the NCAA, his wrestling performance made him a two-time All American.

He eventually turned to professional MMA in 2011 and won his first eight fights before signing with the UFC. He has since then become a serious player in the UFC’s bantamweight division.
