            <h3>MOBILE TERMS OF SERVICE</h3>
            <p>
                The Everlast Worldwide mobile message service is operated by Everlast Worldwide. Your use of the Service 
                constitutes your agreement to these terms and conditions. We may modify or cancel the Service or any of its 
                features without notice. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may also modify these Mobile Terms at 
                any time and your continued use of the Service following the effective date of any such changes shall constitute 
                your acceptance of such changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                By consenting to Everlast Worldwide’s SMS/text messaging service, you agree to receive recurring SMS/text 
                messages from and on behalf of Everlast Worldwide through your wireless provider to the mobile number you 
                provided, even if your mobile number is registered on any state or federal Do Not Call list. Text messages may 
                be sent using an automatic telephone dialing system or other technology. Service-related messages may include 
                updates, alerts, and information (e.g., order updates, account alerts, etc.). Promotional messages may include 
                promotions, specials, and other marketing offers (e.g., cart reminders).
            </p>
            <p>
                You understand that you do not have to sign up for this program in order to make any purchases, and your 
                consent is not a condition of any purchase with Everlast Worldwide. Your participation in this program is 
                completely voluntary.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do not charge for the Service, but you are responsible for all charges and fees associated with text 
                messaging imposed by your wireless provider. Message frequency varies. Message and data rates may apply. 
                Check your mobile plan and contact your wireless provider for details. You are solely responsible for all charges 
                related to SMS/text messages, including charges from your wireless provider.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may opt-out of the Service at any time. Text the single keyword command STOP to +18444870198 or click 
                the unsubscribe link (where available) in any text message to cancel. You'll receive a one-time opt-out 
                confirmation text message. No further messages will be sent to your mobile device, unless initiated by you. 
                If you have subscribed to other Everlast Worldwide mobile message programs and wish to cancel, except where 
                applicable law requires otherwise, you will need to opt out separately from those programs by following the 
                instructions provided in their respective mobile terms.
            </p>
            <p>For Service support or assistance, text HELP to +18444870198 or email ecommerce@everlast.com.</p>
            <p>
                We may change any short code or telephone number we use to operate the Service at any time and will notify 
                you of these changes. You acknowledge that any messages, including any STOP or HELP requests, you send to 
                a short code or telephone number we have changed may not be received and we will not be responsible for 
                honoring requests made in such messages. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The wireless carriers supported by the Service are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages. You agree to 
                provide us with a valid mobile number. If you get a new mobile number, you will need to sign up for the program
                with your new number.
            </p>
            <p>
                To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that we will not be liable for failed, delayed, or misdirected 
                delivery of any information sent through the Service, any errors in such information, and/or any action you may 
                or may not take in reliance on the information or Service.
